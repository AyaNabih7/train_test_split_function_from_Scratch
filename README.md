# ðŸ§® Train-Test Split Function from Scratch

This repository contains a simple Python implementation of a **Train-Test Split** function â€” a fundamental step in preparing datasets for machine learning models.  
Instead of using `train_test_split` from scikit-learn, this project shows how to build it manually using only **NumPy** and **Pandas**.

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

When training machine learning models, we need to divide our dataset into:
- **Training set** â†’ Used to train the model.  
- **Testing set** â†’ Used to evaluate model performance on unseen data.

This notebook demonstrates:
- How to shuffle dataset indices manually.
- How to split data into training and testing sets.
- How to use random seeds for reproducibility.
